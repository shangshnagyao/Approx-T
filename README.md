# Approx-T
Source code of Paper ‘Approx-T: Design Methodology for Approximate Multiplication Units via Taylor-expansion’.

The /rtl directory contains the Approx-T HDL source code, encompassing unsigned integer, signed integer, fixed-point, and floating-point implementations. 
The directory structure is as follows:
