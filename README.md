# Approx-T
Source code of Paper ‘Approx-T: Design Methodology for Approximate Multiplication Units via Taylor-expansion’.

The /rtl directory contains the Approx-T HDL source code, encompassing unsigned integer, signed integer, fixed-point, and floating-point implementations. 
The /tb directory contains the corresponding RTL testbenches. 
The /model directory contains the Approx-T error model. 
The /fpga directory contains the bitstreams and test files for the FPGA implementation, all based on the PYNQ framework using an Ultra96v2 FPGA.
